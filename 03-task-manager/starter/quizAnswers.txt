1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

- Middleware is essentially a function take takes three parameters
req and res, which are objects and next which is a function that 
when invoked will point towards the next middleware to execute. 
Middleware is normally utilized to process and alter an incoming 
request from the frontend before it reaches the backend and can 
even be used to send a response to the frontend before it reaches 
a specific event handler.  

2. What does CRUD stand for?

- CRUD stands for create, read, update, delete which are the four 
basic operations of data storage. 

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
  
  a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
  
  - To allow an app to access information stored in the .env file, you will have to install 
  the dotenv package and require it like so 'require('dotenv').config()' within the file
  which the variable is needed. Then you can access the variable by using this syntax 
  'process.env.VARIABLE' where VARIABLE is substituted with the name of the variable 
  you are trying to use.
  
  b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
  
  - This can be done by adding the name of the .env file to a .gitignore 
  file and by doing this it won't be tracked when other files are being 
  added to the staging area, committed, or pushed to the github repo.
